      <p>If you have stumbled upon this website by accident then I would like to extend a sincere apology to you and this chaotic display of a page. This was done with the intention that only my Business Info. Systems and Technology teacher would see it. </p>
      <p>My name is Vin and I am a &quot;freshman&quot; at the University of Maine in Orono. I transfered from being a Fashion Design Major from Mass. College of Art and Design to here. Yes, I agree that it is a huge change but I was always more interested in the design part of fashion rather than the design portion. So, well, here I am.Well, since you've already made it this far, you might as well keep going. Look around, click stuff, NOTICE ME SEMPAI!!</p>
